# Sift All

Testing Sift Science's API in all popular languages. Some languages are supported officially by Sift Science, some arent.

## Rules
- You have to use existing APIs. You can't extend/fork APIs until you've tried them all.

## Project structure

Every language is under it's own name.

- cURL
- ruby: https://github.com/SiftScience/sift-ruby
- python: https://github.com/SiftScience/sift-python
- php: https://github.com/SiftScience/sift-php
- java: https://github.com/mcac0006/sift-java
- go: https://github.com/0x19/sift-golang
- javascript: https://www.npmjs.com/package/yield-siftscience

## Language Progress

- cURL - DONE
- java - IN PROGRESS
- go
- python
- php
- ruby - TRIED/UNSUCCESSFUL

## Build strategy

1. [ ] Create a full test suite in a statically typed language (java or go).
2. [ ] Use the statically typed language as template for other languages.
3. [ ] Add each language incrementally.

- Fork repos if necessary.
