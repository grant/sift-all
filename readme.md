# Sift All

Testing Sift Science's API in all popular languages. Some languages are supported officially by Sift Science, some arent.

## Rules
- You have to use existing APIs. You can't extend/fork APIs until you've tried them all.

## Project structure

Every language is under it's own name.

## Language Progress

TODO(grant) Create table of language progress. Work on these in order until complete

- ruby
- php
- java
- go

## Build strategy

1. [ ] Create a full test suite in a statically typed language (java or go).
2. [ ] Use the statically typed language as template for other languages.
3. [ ] Add each language incrementally.

- Fork repos if necessary.
